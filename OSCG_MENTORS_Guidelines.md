# Mentor Guidelines

This document defines the responsibilities, boundaries, and workflow for mentors.

Mentors guide contributors and **escalate decisions when required**.
They do **not** make final project-wide decisions.

---

## Role of a Mentor

As a mentor, you are expected to:

* Help contributors understand project structure and workflow
* Provide technical guidance and review feedback
* Ensure contribution standards are followed
* Identify when escalation is required

Mentors act as **guides and gatekeepers**, not decision-makers.

---

## Communication Channel

All mentor–contributor communication **must happen in GitHub Discussions**.

Discussion link:
[https://github.com/BITS-Rohit/tweakio-sdk/discussions/14](https://github.com/BITS-Rohit/tweakio-sdk/discussions/14)

Do not move support or decision-related conversations to private messages.

## Mentorship Workflow

### 1 Onboard Contributors

* Direct contributors to the README and contribution guide
* Clarify project scope and expectations
* Redirect unclear or broad questions to Discussions

---

### 2 Guide, Do Not Implement

* Explain concepts, approach, and trade-offs
* Avoid coding solutions on behalf of contributors
* Encourage contributors to make and own the changes

---

### 3 Review Contributions

* Review PRs for correctness, clarity, and scope
* Request changes when required
* Keep feedback specific, technical, and actionable

Avoid vague or non-actionable feedback.

---

### 4 Handle New Ideas and Scope Changes

If a contributor proposes:

* New features
* Design or architectural changes
* Breaking changes
* Scope expansion

Then:

* Move the discussion to GitHub Discussions
* Ensure the proposal is clearly summarized

Do **not** approve or reject major changes independently.

---

### 5 Escalation to Project Admins

Escalate when:

* Project direction is affected
* Consensus cannot be reached
* Multiple components are impacted

Provide admins with:

* A concise summary
* Relevant discussion and PR links
* Your technical assessment

---

### 6 Maintain Project Standards

* Enforce contribution rules consistently
* Close low-effort, spam, or out-of-scope requests
* Set expectations early to reduce churn

---

### 7 Availability Expectations

* Respond on a best-effort basis
* Immediate responses are not guaranteed
* Silence does **not** imply approval

---

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

Mentors are expected to:

* De-escalate conflicts
* Enforce respectful communication
* Report serious violations to project admins

---

## Authority Boundaries

Mentors can:

* Guide contributors
* Review and request changes
* Escalate decisions

Mentors cannot:

* Override project admins
* Merge PRs without explicit permission
* Redefine project scope or direction

---

## Mentor Administrative Requirement

Each mentor **must** open a Pull Request adding the following entry to the
`OSCG_CONTRIBUTOR_Guidelines.md` file:

```
Name : GitHub Profile Link
```

This step is **mandatory** for all mentors.
